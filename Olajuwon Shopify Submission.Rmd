## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Reading the data I prefer file.choose(), where I can manually select the data into the console
```{r}
shopify_data<-read.csv(file.choose(), header=T)
```

Let's see what the data looks like

```{r}
head(shopify_data,10)
tail(shopify_data,10)
```

Loading my data wrangling and visualization libraries
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("ggplot2")
```
Quick look up of shopify data set summary

```{r}
summary(shopify_data)
```
Something quicky stands out to me that the mean order_amount was used as the average order value. Doesn't seem right to me but I'd have to investigate what average order value means or represents.

Visited this link https://www.shopify.com/blog/average-order-value#averageorder and they defined average order value as Revenue/orders. 

Problem solved. 

Time to calculate the actual AOV. 

Q1. A better way to evaluate this data is by adding the order amount

I almost used base R to quickly solve the AOV shopify_AOV<- (sum(shopify_data$order_amount))/(sum(shopify_data$total_items)) but I looked back at the head() and discovered that some shop_id are repeated on the sheet.!

Quick view of how many shops we have.

```{r}
shops <- group_by(shopify_data, shop_id)

summarise(shops,n= n()) %>% 
  arrange (desc(n))
```


Time to use dplyr, lot of shift ctrl M :)
```{r}
shopify_data %>% 
  group_by(shop_id) %>% 
  summarise (shopify_AOV= sum(order_amount)/sum(total_items)) %>% 
  summarise (mean(shopify_AOV))


```
Time for some data VIZ, pictures tell a thousand words time to see what's going on per shop

```{r}
ggplot(shopify_data)+
  geom_jitter(aes(order_amount,total_items, size=total_items))+
  scale_color_gradient(low="orange", high="purple")+
  theme_classic()+
  labs(title = "total items VS order amount",x="order_amount",y= "total_items") 
```


I'd take a minute to pause and recondsider using the mean as a measure of central tendency!!! That's a huge outlier!!!!

I honestly should have visualized and done some data inspection at the start. I'd use the median.


```{r}
shopify_data %>% 
  group_by(shop_id) %>% 
  summarise (shopify_AOV= sum(order_amount)/sum(total_items)) %>% 
  summarise (median(shopify_AOV))
```

The value i'll report is 153, also I notify the team about this outlier. Which can be found by using arrange(desc())


```
